##### Changes in @enkryptcom/extension-bridge Fork

- Typescript formating
- Changes necessary for enKrypt extension

##### Changes in this Fork

- build esm instead of cjs (for better bundler optimization)
- use `nanoevents` instead of `events` (decoupled form node module)
- [type safe protocols](#type-safe-protocols)

## How much easy exactly?

This much

<a name="example"></a>

```javascript
// Inside devtools script
import { sendMessage } from "webext-bridge";

// ...

button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const res = await sendMessage(
    "get-selection",
    { ignoreCasing: true },
    "content-script"
  );
  console.log(res); // > "The brown fox is alive and well"
});
```

```javascript
// Inside content script
import { sendMessage, onMessage } from "webext-bridge";

onMessage("get-selection", async (message) => {
  const {
    sender,
    data: { ignoreCasing },
  } = message;

  console.log(sender.context, sender.tabId); // > content-script  156

  const { selection } = await sendMessage(
    "get-preferences",
    { sync: false },
    "background"
  );
  return calculateSelection(data.ignoreCasing, selection);
});
```

```javascript
// Inside background script
import { onMessage } from "webext-bridge";

onMessage("get-preferences", ({ data }) => {
  const { sync } = data;

  return loadUserPreferences(sync);
});
```

> Examples above require transpilation and/or bundling using `webpack`/`babel`/`rollup`

`webext-bridge` handles everything for you as efficiently as possible. No more `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` or `chrome.runtime.onConnect` or `chrome.runtime.connect` ....

## Setup

### Install

```bash
$ npm i webext-bridge
```

#### Light it up

Just `import { } from 'webext-bridge'` wherever you need it and use as shown in [example above](#example)

> Even if your extension doesn't need a background page or wont be sending/receiving messages in background script.
> <br> `webext-bridge` uses background/event context as staging area for messages, therefore it **must** loaded in background/event page for it to work.
> <br> (Attempting to send message from any context will fail silently if `webext-bridge` isn't available in background page).
> <br> See [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) for more.

## Type Safe Protocols

As we are likely to use `sendMessage` and `onMessage` in different context, keep the type consistent could be hard and easy to make mistakes. `webext-bridge` provide a smarter way to make the type for protocols much easier.

Create `shim.d.ts` file with the following content and make sure it's been included in `tsconfig.json`.

```ts
// shim.d.ts
import { ProtocolWithReturn } from "webext-bridge";

declare module "webext-bridge" {
  export interface ProtocolMap {
    foo: { title: string };
    // to specify the return type of the message,
    // use the `ProtocolWithReturn` type wrapper
    bar: ProtocolWithReturn<CustomDataType, CustomReturnType>;
  }
}
```

```ts
import { onMessage } from 'webext-bridge'

onMessage('foo', ({ data }) => {
  // type of `data` will be `{ title: string }`
  console.log(data.title)
}
```

```ts
import { sendMessage } from "webext-bridge";

const returnData = await sendMessage("bar", {
  /* ... */
});
// type of `returnData` will be `CustomReturnType` as specified
```

## API

### `sendMessage(messageId: string, data: any, destination: string)`

Sends a message to some other part of your extension, out of the box.

Notes:

- If there is no listener on the other side an error will be thrown where `sendMessage` was called.

- Listener on the other may want to reply. Get the reply by `await`ing the returned `Promise`

- An error thrown in listener callback (in the destination context) will behave as usual, that is, bubble up, but the same error will also be thrown where `sendMessage` was called

##### `messageId`

> Required | `string`

Any `string` that both sides of your extension agree on. Could be `get-flag-count` or `getFlagCount`, as long as it's same on receiver's `onMessage` listener.

##### `data`

> Required | `any`

Any serializable value you want to pass to other side, latter can access this value by refering to `data` property of first argument to `onMessage` callback function.

##### `destination`

> Required | `string | `

The actual identifier of other endpoint.
Example: `devtools` or `content-script` or `background` or `content-script@133` or `devtools@453`

`content-script`, `window` and `devtools` destinations can be suffixed with `@<tabId>` to target specific tab. Example: `devtools@351`, points to devtools panel inspecting tab with id 351.

For `content-script`, a specific `frameId` can be specified by appending the `frameId` to the suffix `@<tabId>.<frameId>`.

Read `Behavior` section to see how destinations (or endpoints) are treated.

> Note: For security reasons, if you want to receive or send messages to or from `window` context, one of your extension's content script must call `allowWindowMessaging(<namespace: string>)` to unlock message routing. Also call `setNamespace(<namespace: string>)` in those `window` contexts. Use same namespace string in those two calls, so `webext-bridge` knows which message belongs to which extension (in case multiple extensions are using `webext-bridge` in one page)

---

### `onMessage(messageId: string, callback: fn)`

Register one and only one listener, per messageId per context. That will be called upon `sendMessage` from other side.

Optionally, send a response to sender by returning any value or if async a `Promise`.

##### `messageId`

> Required | `string`

Any `string` that both sides of your extension agree on. Could be `get-flag-count` or `getFlagCount`, as long as it's same in sender's `sendMessage` call.

##### `callback`

> Required | `fn`

A callback function `Bridge` should call when a message is received with same `messageId`. The callback function will be called with one argument, a `BridgeMessage` which has `sender`, `data` and `timestamp` as its properties.

Optionally, this callback can return a value or a `Promise`, resolved value will sent as reply to sender.

Read [security note](#security) before using this.

---

### `allowWindowMessaging(namespace: string)`

> Caution: Dangerous action

Applicable to content scripts (noop if called from anywhere else)

Unlocks the transmission of messages to and from `window` (top frame of loaded page) contexts in the tab where it is called.
`webext-bridge` by default won't transmit any payload to or from `window` contexts for security reasons.
This method can be called from a content script (in top frame of tab), which opens a gateway for messages.

Once again, `window` = the top frame of any tab. That means **allowing window messaging without checking origin first** will let JavaScript loaded at `https://evil.com` talk with your extension and possibly give indirect access to things you won't want to, like `history` API. You're expected to ensure the
safety and privacy of your extension's users.

##### `namespace`

> Required | `string`

Can be a domain name reversed like `com.github.facebook.react_devtools` or any `uuid`. Call `setNamespace` in `window` context with same value, so that `webext-bridge` knows which payload belongs to which extension (in case there are other extensions using `webext-bridge` in a tab). Make sure namespace string is unique enough to ensure no collisions happen.

---

### `setNamespace(namespace: string)`

Applicable to scripts in top frame of loaded remote page

Sets the namespace `Bridge` should use when relaying messages to and from `window` context. In a sense, it connects the callee context to the extension which called `allowWindowMessaging(<namespace: string>)` in it's content script with same namespace.

##### `namespace`

> Required | `string`

Can be a domain name reversed like `com.github.facebook.react_devtools` or any `uuid`. Call `setNamespace` in `window` context with same value, so that `webext-bridge` knows which payload belongs to which extension (in case there are other extensions using `webext-bridge` in a tab). Make sure namespace string is unique enough to ensure no collisions happen.

### Extras

The following API is built on top of `sendMessage` and `onMessage`, basically, it's just a wrapper, the routing and security rules still apply the same way.

#### `openStream(channel: string, destination: string)`

Opens a `Stream` between caller and destination.

Returns a `Promise` which resolves with `Stream` when the destination is ready (loaded and `onOpenStreamChannel` callback registered).
Example below illustrates a use case for `Stream`

##### `channel`

> Required | `string`

`Stream`(s) are strictly scoped `sendMessage`(s). Scopes could be different features of your extension that need to talk to the other side, and those scopes are named using a channel id.

##### `destination`

> Required | `string`

Same as `destination` in `sendMessage(msgId, data, destination)`

---

#### `onOpenStreamChannel(channel: string, callback: fn)`

Registers a listener for when a `Stream` opens.
Only one listener per channel per context

##### `channel`

> Required | `string`

`Stream`(s) are strictly scoped `sendMessage`(s). Scopes could be different features of your extension that need to talk to the other side, and those scopes are named using a channel id.

##### `callback`

> Required | `fn`

Callback that should be called whenever `Stream` is opened from the other side. Callback will be called with one argument, the `Stream` object, documented below.

`Stream`(s) can be opened by a malicious webpage(s) if your extension's content script in that tab has called `allowWindowMessaging`, if working with sensitive information use `isInternalEndpoint(stream.info.endpoint)` to check, if `false` call `stream.close()` immediately.

##### Stream Example

```javascript
// background.js

// To-Do
```

<a name="behaviour"></a>

## Behavior

> Following rules apply to `destination` being specified in `sendMessage(msgId, data, destination)` and `openStream(channelId, initialData, destination)`

- Specifying `devtools` as destination from `content-script` will auto-route payload to inspecting `devtools` page if open and listening.

- Specifying `content-script` as destination from `devtools` will auto-route the message to inspected window's top `content-script` page if listening. If page is loading, message will be queued up and delivered when page is ready and listening.

- If `window` context (which could be a script injected by content script) are source or destination of any payload, transmission must be first unlocked by calling `allowWindowMessaging(<namespace: string>)` inside that page's top content script, since `Bridge` will first deliver the payload to `content-script` using rules above, and latter will take over and forward accordingly. `content-script` <-> `window` messaging happens using `window.postMessage` API. Therefore to avoid conflicts, `Bridge` requires you to call `setNamespace(uuidOrReverseDomain)` inside the said window script (injected or remote, doesn't matter).

- Specifying `devtools` or `content-script` or `window` from `background` will throw an error. When calling from `background`, destination must be suffixed with tab id. Like `devtools@745` for `devtools` inspecting tab id 745 or `content-script@351` for top `content-script` at tab id 351.

<a name="security"></a>

## Serious security note

The following note only applies if and only if, you will be sending/receiving messages to/from `window` contexts. There's no security concern if you will be only working with `content-script`, `background` or `devtools` scope, which is default setting.

`window` context(s) in tab `A` get unlocked the moment you call `allowWindowMessaging(namespace)` somewhere in your extension's content script(s) that's also loaded in tab `A`.

Unlike `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.connect`, which requires extension's manifest to specify sites allowed to talk with the extension, `webext-bridge` has no such measure by design, which means any webpage whether you intended or not, can do `sendMessage(msgId, data, 'background')` or something similar that produces same effect, as long as it uses same protocol used by `webext-bridge` and namespace set to same as yours.

So to be safe, if you will be interacting with `window` contexts, treat `webext-bridge` as you would treat `window.postMessage` API.

Before you call `allowWindowMessaging`, check if that page's `window.location.origin` is something you expect already.

As an example if you plan on having something critical, **always** verify the `sender` before responding:

```javascript
// background.js
import { onMessage, isInternalEndpoint } from "webext-bridge";

onMessage("getUserBrowsingHistory", (message) => {
  const { data, sender } = message;
  // Respond only if request is from 'devtools', 'content-script' or 'background' endpoint
  if (isInternalEndpoint(sender)) {
    const { range } = data;
    return getHistory(range);
  }
});
```

## Troubleshooting

- Doesn't work?
  <br>If `window` contexts are not part of the puzzle, `webext-bridge` works out of the box for messaging between `devtools` <-> `background` <-> `content-script`(s). If even that is not working, it's likely that `webext-bridge` hasn't been loaded in background page of your extension, which is used by `webext-bridge` as a staging area. If you don't need a background page for yourself, here's bare minimum to get `webext-bridge` going.

```javascript
// background.js (requires transpiration/bundling using webpack(recommended))

import "webext-bridge";
```

```javascript
// manifest.json

{
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["path/to/transpiled/background.js"]
  }
}
```

- Can't send messages to `window`?
  <br>Sending or receiving messages from or to `window` requires you to open the messaging gateway in content script(s) for that particular tab. Call `allowWindowMessaging(<namespaceA: string>)` in any of your content script(s) in that tab and call `setNamespace(<namespaceB: string>)` in the
  script loaded in top frame i.e the `window` context. Make sure that `namespaceA === namespaceB`. If you're doing this, read the [security note above](#security)
